# Tandy Portable Disk Drive Emulator
 
Emulates the file access mode of the TPDD with a linux system over a serial 
port. Currently only implements a single directory like the actual drive, 
and doesn't implement the extensions for subdirectory access.

Filenames are truncated down to the 6.2 format used with the TPDD, if 
multiple files in the specified directory would truncate to the same name
then the first one in the directory listing will be accessed.

Tested with DRVMGR.BA / DRVMGR.CO on a TRS-80 Model 100.
